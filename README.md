# Minimalistic CDK app in Typescript
This is an absolutely minimal set of files to create CDK application in Typescript

# Stats

~50 lines of code in [app.ts](./bin/app.ts)

Synthesized Cloudformaiton template contains ~450 lines (one had to write manually - 10x improvement!)

# Getting started

`npm install`

`npx cdk list`

`npx cdk synth`
